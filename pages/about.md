## Meeting a need

Gratitude is a skill worth practicing, and currently in low supply. The gift of appreciation goes far beyond the practice of bringing more joy to oneself through the intentional noticing of life's little gifts. Gratitude allows a community to engage with all members as having equally high value, by noting the intrinsic benefit of each member and calling it into the light.

For many, it is so easy to see the benefit of a handful of a community's members, but rarely their own value and gifts that they bring, and rarely the value of those often considered 'small' in society. This site is to encourage everyone - big and small, meek and loud, helping and hurting - to see their own value and the value of every person around them, and practice the skill of appreciation.

Day after day there are touted specific days of appreciation (and every list I've found shows different holiday designations - combined, they seem countless!) and while these days have their benefits of focusing our minds and bringing appreciation to those whose work and benefit are often unnoticed, or appreciation unvocalized, so much more can be done to harness gratitude. Every day, every person, everywhere. Everyone is worth appreciating, including you!
